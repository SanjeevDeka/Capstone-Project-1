# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Introduction:
Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, customer turnover, or customer defection, is the loss of clients or customers. Telephone service companies, e-commerce companies, internet service providers, pay TV companies, insurance firms, etc., often use customer churn analysis and customer churn rates as one of their key business metrics because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one. Churn rate is the amount of customers or subscribers who cut ties with the service or company during a given time period. These customers have "churned".

## Problem at hand:
Predicting the behaviour of the customers leading to churn.

## Value to client:
A telecom company has been affected by the increasing number of customers subscribing to the services of a competitor. It is much more expensive to attract new customers than retaining old customers. At the same time, spending too much on or spending on the wrong factor for retaining a customer who has no intention to leave (or who was not leaving for that factor which was addressed) could be a waste of money. Therefore it is important to identify the customer who has high probability of leaving. An analysis of the past records of the customers can give great insights on who might leave and what is the cause.

We can predict behaviour to retain customers. We can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.
